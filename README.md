# NAME

App::Greple::xlate - translation support module for greple

# SYNOPSIS

    greple -Mxlate -e ENGINE --xlate pattern target-file

    greple -Mxlate::deepl --xlate pattern target-file

# VERSION

Version 0.9906

# DESCRIPTION

**Greple** **xlate** module find desired text blocks and replace them by
the translated text.  Currently DeepL (`deepl.pm`) and ChatGPT
(`gpt3.pm`) module are implemented as a back-end engine.
Experimental support for gpt-4 and gpt-4o are also included.

If you want to translate normal text blocks in a document written in
the Perl's pod style, use **greple** command with `xlate::deepl` and
`perl` module like this:

    greple -Mxlate::deepl -Mperl --pod --re '^([\w\pP].*\n)+' --all foo.pm

In this command, pattern string `^([\w\pP].*\n)+` means consecutive
lines starting with alpha-numeric and punctuation letter.  This
command show the area to be translated highlighted.  Option **--all**
is used to produce entire text.

    <img width="750" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaz-utashiro/App-Greple-xlate/main/images/select-area.png">
    </p>
</div>

Then add `--xlate` option to translate the selected area.  Then, it
will find the desired sections and replace them by the **deepl**
command output.

By default, original and translated text is printed in the "conflict
marker" format compatible with [git(1)](http://man.he.net/man1/git).  Using `ifdef` format, you
can get desired part by [unifdef(1)](http://man.he.net/man1/unifdef) command easily.  Output format
can be specified by **--xlate-format** option.

    </p>
</div>

If you want to translate entire text, use **--match-all** option.  This
is a short-cut to specify the pattern `(?s).+` which matches entire
text.

Conflict marker format data can be viewed in side-by-side style by
`sdif` command with `-V` option.  Since it makes no sense to compare
on a per-string basis, the `--no-cdif` option is recommended.  If you
do not need to color the text, specify `--no-textcolor` (or
`--no-tc`).

    sdif -V --no-tc --no-cdif data_shishin.deepl-EN-US.cm

# NORMALIZATION

Processing is done in specified units, but in the case of a sequence
of multiple lines of non-empty text, they are converted together into
a single line.  This operation is performed as follows:

- Remove white space at the beginning and end of each line.
- If a line ends with a full-width punctuation character, concatenate
with next line.
- If a line ends with a full-width character and the next line begins
with a full-width character, concatenate the lines.
- If either the end or the beginning of a line is not a full-width
character, concatenate them by inserting a space character.

Cache data is managed based on the normalized text, so even if
modifications are made that do not affect the normalization results,
the cached translation data will still be effective.

This normalization process is performed only for the first (0th) and
even-numbered pattern.  Thus, if two patterns are specified as
follows, the text matching the first pattern will be processed after
normalization, and no normalization process will be performed on the
text matching the second pattern.

    greple -Mxlate -E normalized -E not-normalized

Therefore, use the first pattern for text that is to be processed by
combining multiple lines into a single line, and use the second
pattern for pre-formatted text.  If there is no text to match in the
first pattern, use a pattern that does not match anything, such as
`(?!)`.

# MASKING

Occasionally, there are parts of text that you do not want translated.
For example, tags in markdown files. DeepL suggests that in such
cases, the part of the text to be excluded be converted to XML tags,
translated, and then restored after the translation is complete.  To
support this, it is possible to specify the parts to be masked from
translation.

    --xlate-setopt maskfile=MASKPATTERN

This will interpret each line of the file \`MASKPATTERN\` as a regular
expression, translate strings matching it, and revert after
processing.  Lines beginning with `#` are ignored.

Complex pattern can be written on multiple lines with backslash
escpaed newline.

How the text is transformed by masking can be seen by **--xlate-mask**
option.

This interface is experimental and subject to change in the future.

# OPTIONS

- **--xlate**
- **--xlate-color**
- **--xlate-fold**
- **--xlate-fold-width**=_n_ (Default: 70)

    Invoke the translation process for each matched area.

    Without this option, **greple** behaves as a normal search command.  So
    you can check which part of the file will be subject of the
    translation before invoking actual work.

    Command result goes to standard out, so redirect to file if necessary,
    or consider to use [App::Greple::update](https://metacpan.org/pod/App%3A%3AGreple%3A%3Aupdate) module.

    Option **--xlate** calls **--xlate-color** option with **--color=never**
    option.

    With **--xlate-fold** option, converted text is folded by the specified
    width.  Default width is 70 and can be set by **--xlate-fold-width**
    option.  Four columns are reserved for run-in operation, so each line
    could hold 74 characters at most.

- **--xlate-engine**=_engine_

    Specifies the translation engine to be used. If you specify the engine
    module directly, such as `-Mxlate::deepl`, you do not need to use
    this option.

    At this time, the following engines are available

    - **deepl**: DeepL API
    - **gpt3**: gpt-3.5-turbo
    - **gpt4**: gpt-4-turbo
    - **gpt4o**: gpt-4o-mini

        **gpt-4o**'s interface is unstable and cannot be guaranteed to work
        correctly at the moment.

- **--xlate-labor**
- **--xlabor**

    Instead of calling translation engine, you are expected to work for.
    After preparing text to be translated, they are copied to the
    clipboard.  You are expected to paste them to the form, copy the
    result to the clipboard, and hit return.

- **--xlate-to** (Default: `EN-US`)

    Specify the target language.  You can get available languages by
    `deepl languages` command when using **DeepL** engine.

- **--xlate-format**=_format_ (Default: `conflict`)

    Specify the output format for original and translated text.

    The following formats other than `xtxt` assume that the part to be
    translated is a collection of lines.  In fact, it is possible to
    translate only a portion of a line, and specifying a format other than
    `xtxt` will not produce meaningful results.

    - **conflict**, **cm**

        Original and converted text are printed in [git(1)](http://man.he.net/man1/git) conflict marker
        format.

            <<<<<<< ORIGINAL
            original text
            =======
            translated Japanese text
            >>>>>>> JA

        You can recover the original file by next [sed(1)](http://man.he.net/man1/sed) command.

            sed -e '/^<<<<<<< /d' -e '/^=======$/,/^>>>>>>> /d'

    - **colon**, _:::::::_

        The original and translated text are output in a markdown's custom
        container style.

            ::::::: ORIGINAL
            original text
            :::::::
            ::::::: JA
            translated Japanese text
            :::::::

        Above text will be translated to the following in HTML.

            <div class="ORIGINAL">
            original text
            </div>
            <div class="JA">
            translated Japanese text
            </div>

        Number of colon is 7 by default.  If you specify colon sequence like
        `:::::`, it is used instead of 7 colons.

    - **ifdef**

        Original and converted text are printed in [cpp(1)](http://man.he.net/man1/cpp) `#ifdef`
        format.

            #ifdef ORIGINAL
            original text
            #endif
            #ifdef JA
            translated Japanese text
            #endif

        You can retrieve only Japanese text by the **unifdef** command:

            unifdef -UORIGINAL -DJA foo.ja.pm

    - **space**
    - **space+**

        Original and converted text are printed separated by single blank
        line.  For `space+`, it also outputs a newline after the converted
        text.

    - **xtxt**

        If the format is `xtxt` (translated text) or unkown, only translated
        text is printed.

- **--xlate-maxlen**=_chars_ (Default: 0)

    Specify the maximum length of text to be sent to the API at once.
    Default value is set as for free DeepL account service: 128K for the
    API (**--xlate**) and 5000 for the clipboard interface
    (**--xlate-labor**).  You may be able to change these value if you are
    using Pro service.

- **--xlate-maxline**=_n_ (Default: 0)

    Specify the maximum lines of text to be sent to the API at once.

    Set this value to 1 if you want to translate one line at a time.  This
    option takes precedence over the `--xlate-maxlen` option.

- **--**\[**no-**\]**xlate-progress** (Default: True)

    See the tranlsation result in real time in the STDERR output.

- **--xlate-stripe**

    Use [App::Greple::stripe](https://metacpan.org/pod/App%3A%3AGreple%3A%3Astripe) module to show the matched part by zebra
    striping fashion.  This is useful when the matched parts are connected
    back-to-back.

    The color palette is switched according to the background color of the
    terminal.  If you want to specify explicitly, you can use
    **--xlate-stripe-light** or **--xlate-stripe-dark**.

- **--xlate-mask**

    Perform masking function and display the converted text as is without
    restoration.

- **--match-all**

    Set the whole text of the file as a target area.

# CACHE OPTIONS

**xlate** module can store cached text of translation for each file and
read it before execution to eliminate the overhead of asking to
server.  With the default cache strategy `auto`, it maintains cache
data only when the cache file exists for target file.

Use **--xlate-cache=clear** to initiate cache management or to clean up
all existing cache data.  Once executed with this option, a new cache
file will be created if one does not exist and then automatically
maintained afterward.

- --xlate-cache=_strategy_
    - `auto` (Default)

        Maintain the cache file if it exists.

    - `create`

        Create empty cache file and exit.

    - `always`, `yes`, `1`

        Maintain cache anyway as far as the target is normal file.

    - `clear`

        Clear the cache data first.

    - `never`, `no`, `0`

        Never use cache file even if it exists.

    - `accumulate`

        By default behavior, unused data is removed from the cache file.  If
        you don't want to remove them and keep in the file, use `accumulate`.
- **--xlate-update**

    This option forces to update cache file even if it is not necessary.

# COMMAND LINE INTERFACE

You can easily use this module from the command line by using the
`xlate` command included in the distribution.  See the `xlate` man
page for usage.

The `xlate` command works in concert with the Docker environment, so
even if you do not have anything installed on hand, you can use it as
long as Docker is available.  Use `-D` or `-C` option.

Also, since makefiles for various document styles are provided,
translation into other languages is possible without special
specification.  Use `-M` option.

You can also combine the Docker and `make` options so that you can
run `make` in a Docker environment.

Running like `xlate -C` will launch a shell with the current working
git repository mounted.

Read Japanese article in ["SEE ALSO"](#see-also) section for detail.

# EMACS

Load the `xlate.el` file included in the repository to use `xlate`
command from Emacs editor.  `xlate-region` function translate the
given region.  Default language is `EN-US` and you can specify
language invoking it with prefix argument.
